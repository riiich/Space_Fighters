# Space_Fighters

This is an SFML game application developed in C++ that I created in Fall of 2020.

Space Fighters is a bootleg version of the Space Invaders. 

When the player enters the game, their objective is to stay alive while simultaneously destroying the incoming enemy ships. 

The player is able to fend off these enemy ships by shooting laser shots at them.

Instructions:
	- Player starts off with certain amount of health.
	- There is a score that keeps track of how many enemy ships the player has destroyed.
	- There are mini quests that the player can accomplish in order to get upgrade their laser attack.
	- If the enemy ship comes in contact with the player or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player takes damage.
	- The player loses when their health reaches 0.
